Jaxx Codebase
=============

This is a copy of the full Jaxx codebase (minus third party libraries) of their wallet's back end; it does not contain any UI elements.

This is also found at https://jaxx.io/, but mirroring a version on GitHub allows for easier review and auditing capabilities.

Usage
-----

You can follow the history of the Jaxx codebase by reviewing the commit history inside the [sourceCode](https://github.com/mitchellcash/Jaxx-Codebase/commits/master/sourceCode) folder.

Each version of the Jaxx codebase can also be found as its own respective branch inside the repository.

I am not the author of this code and in no way affiliated with Jaxx.
